# Maxout implementation in Pytorch

In 2013, Goodfellow et al. introduced the paper _Maxout networks_ (https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389). This is a very simple application of it on the MNIST data set (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

The complete implementation can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
